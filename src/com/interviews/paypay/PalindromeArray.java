/*
An array is called palindromic if it remains the same after reversing the order of its elements.
You have an array of strings arr. For each i, arr[i] consists of at least two characters. For each pair of consecutive elements arr[i] and arr[i + 1], you can:

- Move the rightmost character of arr[i] to the leftmost position in arr[i + 1]. For instance, "abc" and "def" will become "ab" and "cdef". This operation can be applied only once to any pair of consecutive elements.
- Move the leftmost character of arr[i + 1] to the rightmost position in arr[i]. For instance, "abc" and "def" will become "abcd" and "ef". Again, this operation can be applied only once to any pair of consecutive elements.
- Do nothing to the pair of consecutive elements.

Is it possible to obtain a palindromic array from arr by performing these operations?

Example:
1. For arr = ["aa", "bab", "cde", "aba", "ab"], the output should be
    solution(arr) = true.

    - Apply the second operation to "aa" and "bab".
    - Apply the first operation to "aba" and "ab".
    This gives us the following array: ["aab", "ab", "cde", "ab", "aab"], which is palindromic.

2. For arr = ["palindrome"], the output should be
    solution(arr) = true.
    The given array is already palindromic, so no operations are needed.

3. For arr = ["aaaaaa", "aa"], the output should be
    solution(arr) = false.
    If moving two characters between two consecutive array elements was allowed, the array could have been made palindromic, but this is impossible given the actual rules.

Input/Output
- [execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
- [memory limit] 1 GB
- [input] array.string arr An array of strings.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 105,
2 ≤ arr[i].length ≤ 10.

[output] boolean

Return true if the given array can be turned into a palindromic array, otherwise return false.
